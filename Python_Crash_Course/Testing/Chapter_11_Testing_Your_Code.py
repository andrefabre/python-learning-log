#  A unit test, verifies the one specific aspect of a functions behaviour is correct
# A test case, is a collection of unit tests that together prove that a function
# behaves the way its supposed to, within the full range of situations you expect
# it to handle.

# A Passing Test
# The test function will call the function we're testing, and we'll make an assertion
# about the value that's returned. If our assertion is correct, the test will pass;
# if the assertion is incorrect the test will fail
