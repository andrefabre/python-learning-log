# Python Learning Log

This repository tracks my journey learning Python through CS50P, textbooks, and side projects.  
It includes notes, exercises, and small experiments that build towards larger portfolio projects.

## Structure
- `/notes` → Summaries of chapters, lectures, and tutorials
- `/exercises` → Practice problems and coding drills
- `/mini_projects` → Small scripts testing new concepts (e.g., file I/O, JSON parsing)

## Topics Covered So Far
- Python basics: variables, functions, conditionals, classes, dictionaries, list, exception handling, pytest
- File handling: reading/writing CSV and JSON
- Data visualization with matplotlib
- Networking and APIs (in progress)
- Cybersecurity and data analysis (in progress)

## Why This Repo?
This is my "lab notebook" — a record of consistent progress as I grow into a cyber/data professional.
