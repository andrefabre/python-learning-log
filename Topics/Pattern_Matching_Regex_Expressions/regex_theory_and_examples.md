# Topic: Pattern Matching and Regex Expressions

## ðŸ“– Theory - 

### Automate the Boring Stuff with Python - TextBook

```python
import re
phoneNumRegex = re.compile(r'\d\d\d-\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d') # phoneNumRegex variable contains a Regex object
mo = phoneNumRegex.search("My number is 415-555-4242.")
print(f"Phone number found: {mo.group()}")

```

- Say you want to separate the area code from the rest of the phone number.
Adding parentheses will create groups in the regex

```python
phoneNumRegex = re.compile(r'(\d\d\d)-(\d\d\d)-(\d\d\d\d)')
mo = phoneNumRegex.search("My number is 415-555-4242.")
mo.group(1) # 415
mo.group(2) # 555
mo.group(3) # 4242 
mo.group() # 415-555-4242
```
- To retrieve all the groups at once, use the groups() method,
note the plural form of the name

```python
mo.groups() # ('415', '555', '4242')
num1, num2, num3 = mo.groups()
print(num1, num2, num3) 

phoneNumRegex = re.compile(r'(\(\d\d\d\))-(\d\d\d)-(\d\d\d\d)')
mo = phoneNumRegex.search("My number is (415)-555-4242.")
mo.group(1) #'(415)'
mo.group(2) # '555'
```

#### Matching multiple groups with the Pipe
- The | character is called a pipe. You can use it anywhere you want to match
one of many expressions.

```python
heroRegex = re.compile(r"Batman|Tina Fey")
mo1 = heroRegex.search("Batman and Tina Fey")
mo1.group() # Batman 

# NOTE: if both terms are in the search string it will return the first one. 
# You can find all matching occurrences with the findall() method.

count = 0
while count != 1:
    try:
        playerChoice = input("Choose rock, paper, scissors").lower()
        throwRegex = re.compile(f"rock|paper|scissors")
        moT = throwRegex.search(playerChoice)
        throw = moT.group()
        print(throw)
        count += 1
    except: 
        print("Invalid Input")
```

- You can also use the pipe method to match one of several patterns as part of your
regex.

```python
batRegex = re.compile(r"Bat(man|mobile|copter|bat)")
mo = batRegex.search("Batmobile lost a wheel")
mo.group() #"Batmobile"
mo.group(1) # "mobile"

count = 0
while count != 1:
    try:
        playerChoice = "rock1"
        throwRegex = re.compile(f"rock(1|2|3)")
        moT = throwRegex.search(playerChoice)
        throw = moT.group(1)
        print(throw)
        count += 1
    except: 
        print("Invalid Input")

```
#### Optional matching with a Question Mark
- If there is a pattern that you only want to match only optionally.
That is the, the regex should find a match regardless of whether that bit of
text is there.
- The ? character flags the group that precedes it as an optional part of the
pattern

```python
batRegex = re.compile(r"Bat(wo)?man")
mo1 = batRegex.search("The Adventures of Batman")
mo1.group() # "Batman"

mo2 = batRegex.search("The Adventures of Batwoman")
mo2.group() # Batwoman
```

#### Match Zero or More with the Star
- The * (called the star or asterix) means "match zero or more".
- The group before the star can occur any number of times in the text.
It can be completely absent or repeated over and over again.

```python
batRegex = re.compile(r"Bat(wo)*man")
mo1 = batRegex.search("The Adventures of Batman")
mo1.group() # "Batman"

mo2 = batRegex.search("The Adventures of Batwoman")
mo2.group() # "Batwoman"

mo3 = batRegex.search("The Adventures of Batwowowowowoman")
mo3.group() # 'Batwowowowowoman'
```

#### Matching 1 or more with the Plus
- The group preceding a plus must appear at least once
```python
batRegex = re.compile(r"Bat(wo)+man")
mo1 = batRegex.search("The Adventures of Batwoman")
mo1.group() # "Batwoman"

mo2 = batRegex.search("The Adventures of Batwowowowoman")
mo2.group() # 'Batwowowowoman'

mo3 = batRegex.search("The Adventures of Batman")
mo3 == None # True
```

#### Matching specific Repetitions with Braces
- If you have a group that you want to repeat a specific number of times, follow
the group in your regex with a number in braces.
- For example, the regex (Ha){3} will match the string "HaHaHa" but it will not
match "HaHa".
- Instead of one number, you can specify a range by writing a minimum, a comma,
and a maximum in between braces Ha{3, 5} will match "Hahaha", "HaHaHaHa" and "HaHaHaHaHa"

#### Greedy and Non-greedy Matching
- Python's regular expressions are greedy by default, which means that in
ambiguous situations they will match the longest string possible

```python
greedyHaRegex = re.compile(r"Ha){3, 5}")
mo1 = greedyHaRegex.search("HaHaHaHaHa")
mo1.group() # "HaHaHaHaHa"

nongreedyHaRegex = re.compile(r"Ha){3, 5}?")
mo2 = nongreedyHaRegex.search("HaHaHaHaHa")
mo2.group() # "HaHaHa"
```
> ðŸ’¡ ***Tip:***
The ? can have two meanings in regular expressions: declaring a non-greedy
match or flagging an optional group. These meanings are entirely unrelated

#### The Findall() method
- The findall() method will return thea list of strings of every match in the searched
string - as long as there are **NO** groups in the regular expression.

```python
phoneNumRegex = re.compile(r"\d\d\d-\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d") # has no groups
phoneNumRegex.findall("Cell: 415-555-9999 Work: 212-555-0000") 
# ['415-555-9999', '212-555-0000']
```

- If there **ARE** groups in the regular expression, then findall() will return a list of **tuples**.
- Each tuple represents a found match, and its items are matched strings for each group in the regex.

```python
phoneNumRegex = re.compile(r"(\d\d\d)-(\d\d\d)-(\d\d\d\d)") # has groups
phoneNumRegex.findall("Cell: 415-555-9999 Work: 212-555-0000") # [('415', '555', '9999'), ('212', '555', '0000')]
```

#### Character Classes
- Making your own Character Classes
  - You can define your own character class using square brackets.
  - For example, the character class [aeiouAEIOU] will match any vowel both lowercase and uppercase.

```python
vowelRegex = re.compile(r"[aeiouAEIOU]")
vowelRegex.findall("Robo cop eats baby food. BABY FOOD.")
# ['o', 'o', 'o', 'e', 'a', 'a', 'o', 'o', 'A', 'O', 'O']
```

- You can also use ranges of numbers using a hyphen.
    - For example, the character class [a-zA-Z0-9] will match all lowercase
     letters, all uppercase letters, and numbers.
- By placing a caret character (^) just after the character class's
     opening bracket, you can make a negative character class.
 - A negative character class will match all the characters that are not in the character class

```python
consonantRegex = re.compile(r"[^aeiouAEIOU]")
consonantRegex.findall("Robo cop eats baby food. BABY FOOD.")
# ['R', 'b', ' ','c', 'p', ' ', 't', 's', ' ', 'b', 'b', 'y', ' ', 'f', 'd', '.', ' ', 'B', 'B', 'Y', ' ', 'F', 'D', '.']
# Instead of matching every vowel, we're matching every character that isn't a vowel
```

#### The Caret Sign and Dollar Sign Characters
- You can use a caret symbol at the start of a regex to indicate that a match
must occur at the **BEGINNING** of the searched text.
- You can put a dollar sign at the end of the regex to indicate the string
must **END** with this regex pattern

```python
beginsWithHello = re.compile(r"^Hello")
beginsWithHello.search("Hello, world!")
# <re.Match object; span=(0, 5), match='Hello'>
beginsWithHello.search("He said, hello") == None
# True
```
